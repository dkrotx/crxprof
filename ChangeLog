v0.3 [03.03.2013]
 - Usage semantics changed: press ENTER to show profile, ^C (once) to exit

v0.2 [02.02.2013]
 - Fixed compiling for x86
 - Doesn't require g++ to compile
 - manpage
 - no memleaks (thank God, it's Valgrind)

v0.1 [12.12.2012]
 - Ready to use. But still not ready for end user (man, detailed usage).
