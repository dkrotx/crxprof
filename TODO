critical:
- cont right from start (even if no CPU events). elsewere - starvation
- adopting to /proc/pid/schedstat (nanosec/usec/msec)
- fix REALTIME profile

critical for user-usage:
- full usage
- mode: ./crxprof [options] -- cmd ...


- reset errno for ptrace
- show unknown bts
- comments in callgrind (usage, time spent, ...)
- starting info (CPU% IO% wall_clock)
- alloc for nodes (and no memleaking)
- reset stat or not

- build system
- man
- blog-record

- (optional) short names for symbols
- (optional) ability to account IOWAIT

discover:
- EINTR in wait(2) [strange bug]
- strange things with syscalls accounting. Libc wrappers should be seen
